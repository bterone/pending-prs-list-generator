# PR Markdown Generator

A Node.js script that fetches pull requests from one or multiple GitHub repositories and generates a unified markdown file with organized listings, prioritizing high-priority PRs.

## Features

- üîç Fetches all open pull requests from any GitHub repository
- üö® Automatically prioritizes PRs with "high priority", "urgent", or "critical" labels
- üìù Generates clean markdown with clickable PR titles
- üîÑ Handles pagination for repositories with many PRs
- üîê Supports GitHub token authentication for higher rate limits
- üîÄ **NEW:** Supports multiple repositories - combines PRs from all repos into unified categories
- üìä Categorizes PRs by review status (needs approval, has comments to fix, etc.)

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

#### Single Repository

```bash
# Using owner/repo format
node pr-generator.js bterone/pending-prs-list-generator

# Using GitHub URL
node pr-generator.js https://github.com/bterone/pending-prs-list-generator

# Specify custom output file
node pr-generator.js owner/repo --output my-custom-prs.md

# If .env file is provided
node --env-file=.env pr-generator.js https://github.com/bterone/pending-prs-list-generator
```

#### Multiple Repositories

```bash
# Combine PRs from multiple repositories
node pr-generator.js owner/repo1 owner/repo2 owner/repo3

# Mix different URL formats
node pr-generator.js owner/repo1 https://github.com/bterone/pending-prs-list-generator

# Specify custom output file for multiple repos
node pr-generator.js owner/repo1 owner/repo2 --output combined-prs.md
```

When using multiple repositories, all PRs are combined into unified categories regardless of which repository they came from. The PR links will correctly point to their respective repositories.

### With GitHub Token (Recommended)

For higher rate limits and access to private repositories:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
node pr-generator.js your-org/your-repo
```

### Example Output

5. **Have some comments to fix** üîß - PRs with unresolved comments
6. **Needs merging** ü§™ - PRs with 2+ approvals ready to merge
